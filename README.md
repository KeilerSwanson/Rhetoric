# Rhetoric

Rhetoric is a simple tool for comparing news coverage across the media landscape. Search for articles by topic, select which media sources you want results from, and manage a reading list.

## Source Selection

Media sources were selected based on:
- Bias, reliability, and audience size ratings from the [Ad Fontes Media Bias Chart](https://adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/)
- Availability via the [Newscatcher API](https://newscatcherapi.com)
- My personal judgement of a source's utility (e.g. Pew Research)
- Avoiding a bloated source list

Inclusion of a source does not imply an endorsement.

## Technologies Used
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - 12.0.7
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - 1.45.1
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - 2.28.0
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - 4.3.1
- [Newscatcher](https://newscatcherapi.com/)

## Future Versions

I plan to make Rhetoric full-stack and add more features in the future. Some ideas include:
- Custom media source presets
- News feeds for saved queries
- Email notifications
